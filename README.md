# Improvement 

A iOS mobile application that allows you to learn study sets. Allowing you to progress as you study.


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Swift, Firebase, SwiftUI

I decided to create it for myself in order to help myself study for my upcoming exams. For now it will have basic functionality where you will be able to see and create your study sets. Maybe called progress pal?

-I want to include the ability to scramble and match the definitions with the terms.
